                            <p>Hello, So, I was watching bjergsen's stream and I saw that some jerks are spamming his client with dicks. I used to send some messages to friends for fun too, but what community is doing to streamers is disgusting and it also crashes their clients. So, I've decided to present you (hopefully) a solution to this: (note: summoner IDs used in this example are made up, they don't reflect any real person doing this. Any resemblance is purely coincidental.) 1) download pidgin IM client: https://www.pi. Also, can it please support notifications? (I have a Windows and Mac, but I mainly use my Mac for my college work and screwing around.). This will be my 3rd or 4th project with arduino. I was looking to send a serial signal to the arduino whenever I get an IM from Skype or Pidgin. However, I have no idea how to detect when I get an IM, can anyone offer assistance? Thank you for your time. Slight update: Skype charges 5 dollars for keypairs and the API and such, so I think this will be a wash. Another update: I tried hooking the User32 dll, so that whenever an icon on the taskbar flashed (like pidgin and skype do) it would execu. The Arch wiki will enrich your life. (https://wiki.archlinux.org/) This thing has more documentation in it then you could ever hope to maintain in your little head. If you're on Arch then this is the goldmine you're looking for, there is still a lot of useful information on there about certain ways that Linux functions even if you're on another distro though. On a side note, learning to install Arch will change your life. (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) 
I know this post is a bit unconventional for this sub, but, I will post it anyway. I think there are a lot of scenarios, where you would not lose electricity, but, might lose connection to internet. Wars, terrorist attacks, some crazy guy cutting couple optical cables. # Grab stuff from internet, before they take it from you In case something happens to your internet connection, or internet as a whole, you want to be able to access all knowledge you need, without it. ## What could. PSA--Long post ahead. tl;dr for the first half of this: You might be getting spied on. Skip to the numbered part and I'll teach you how to protect yourself. I will not explain in detail how these things work in this post, because I want anyone, regardless of their tech prowess, to find these suggestions accessible. It is also because I am by no means an expert in this area, and do not wish to spread misinformation. Luckily, the information is readily available all over the net, if you would. I've had multiple people (mostly new XP users) on this sub ask me what software is available for XP. I've been answering by saying that there's an XP version of virtually all Windows software, and that you can find an XP program to accomplish just abut anything you'd ever want to accomplish on a PC. I've since realized that this leaves them with no starting point and no examples of software a person might want/need to have installed, so I'm posting a small number of recommendations or examples. :-- :-- Version 2.13.0 ( Other Versions ( Vendor Pidgin Category Messaging Architecture x86/64 bit Package Release Date 2018-07-16 I mport into PDQ Deploy (https://secure.pdq.com/subscription/generateshortcut?4327) Pidgin 2.13.0 ampnbsp; External References Pidgin, the universal chat client (https://. --gt Discord lt-- 1) Download the Discord (https://discordapp.com/) app on the platform of your choice.

So yesterday, I opened up League and download the latest patch. Go to log in and it says my account has been permanently suspended. I go to my email and I get this. This has come to a complete shock to me because I have no clue how I could have done any of this. I have never had any punishment before from the Tribunal. I have no clue how I could have illegally modified my client. The only 3rd party program Free Software as defined by the GNU Project (https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html): gt“Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”. Why I think this is of vital importance to socialism. We've learned how to encrypt our emails, but what about encrypting our instant messages. Many of us send more data through IM programs than through email, as it can be far more convenient for casual conversations and ongoing dialogue. Instant messaging, however, can be spied upon just as much as email, especially when we use services like Facebook Chat, which stores the entirety of our conversations forever. Fortunately for us security-inclined (read paranoid) individuals, there exists a piece. 
Journalists today are facing ever-increasing security challenges. With more and more sensitive information being stored or transmitted digitally, the attack surface against journalists has become large. Often this can be of little consequence, but in some cases it can put a source's reputation, career, or even life at risk. And with governments continuing to crack down on free press, all journalists should begin to develop more robust security practices. Even those with low threat models It seems like it is sometimes hard to find good open source software for Mac OS X. To try and help people, and out of sheer boredom, I made this list: Edit: I decided that I want to keep this list to simpler things about on par with what is here now. I say this because if you use the higher level types of software, you likely don't have much trouble finding open source options. I will still update it for a while, I will just not include programming-level things anymore. Web Browsing:. A few of us have a nice little IRC chatroom going on, where we discuss KS, amongst other things.

Crossposted from my post at /r/anonymous (https://pay.reddit.com/r/anonymous/comments/weejl/im_a_pedophile_in_my_late_teens_here_are_my/) Excuse me for this TL;DR that might feel a little unstructured. This is the first time I've ever written about this publicly. I was writing this as a pm to aitbiz, asking if he would mind to have a chat with me, but my rambling got a bit too long and I thought it would perhaps be interesting to share my thoughts with the public. I would be glad to clarify. I see a ton of you who have joined up, have completed your ESA (otherwise you would not be in corp anymore) - but are totally absent from jabber and mumble. Also, you know about SIGs, right? Please remember that we can help you get these setup - just talk to us in corp, or ask questions in the Little_bees channel. Without jabber - you are never going to have any idea when anything is going on, and eventually grow bored of space jewing. Plus, going on ops from time to time is GREAT I made an AutoHotKey script a while ago that implements the OS X text editing shortcuts on Windows (option-e-e = é, option-left jumps to the previous word, etc.) and lets you use command-tab and command-~ to switch between apps and windows. Here are some other features: - command-Q to quit the current app, or command-H to hide - show mounted drives on the Desktop - disables tapping the Windows key to show the Start Screen - disables Alt to focus on the menu bar - F11 is remapped to Windows-. As many of you may know we have an IRC channel which can be accessed through this link ( Now what is IRC you may ask? IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat, essentially it is a platform to run chatrooms and share files (this is not an aspect of the BaPC channel). In our case, we use the channel as quick help for troubleshooting and hardware discussion, its also a community where we can just have a general chat. Well that sounds. 
We're aware of Ninite, but we feel we should have a thread on the BEST software. This will be a frequently updated guide on the best software to use for each category listed. If you feel a program should be up for consideration, POST IT IN THE COMMENTS with a link to the download and what category it is in. POST SUGGESTIONS AND UPVOTE SUGGESTIONS, ADD CATEGORIES OR SOFTWARE TO THE LIST BY POSTING IN COMMENTS. The separation between core applications and encryption technologies impedes user adoption, and leaves everyone more vulnerable. The status of privacy would be much improved if developers would incorporate encryption technologies into their product by default, rather than requiring users to separately select, download, and install plug-ins.
